      <div class="grid">
        <p>For the Summer of 2018, I served as a UX Developer for a web 
           platform called QUINCE, an abbreviation for the lengthy title: Quality 
           of Internet Consumer Experience. This platform enables end-users to 
           easily participate in various internet measurement tasks. Participants can,
           in turn, accumulate virtual points and redeem them for rewards in the form
           of currency.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="body-container">
      <div class="grid"><div><p id="body-header">Responsibility</p></div></div>
      <div class="grid">
        <p>Under the supervision of Ricky, I helped design and develop the web 
           platform to increase participant engagement. Naturally, I spent some
           time researching effective ways to gamify measurement tasks so that 
           they would appeal more to paricipants. As for the visual side, I 
           worked directly to improve the layout of pages, to enhance visualizations 
           by trying out various icons and images, and to implement interactive 
           elements. I also repaired visual bugs and design breakdowns on
           the existing platform. Last but not least, I was tasked with 
           visualizing the participants’ measurement results.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="subheader caida-subheader">Consent Form</p>
        <p>The consent form is the first thing participants see when accessing 
           the web platform. I expanded the form vertically to cover a larger
           area of the screen than before and a gradient shadow was placed at the bottom of the form to indicate the presence of a scroll functionality. At a glance, the consent form is an organized, interactive element that 
           informs participants.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="subheader caida-subheader">Tutorial Modal</p>
          <p>The tutorial modal window introduces participants to the interface 
             and what their tasks are. Originally, the modal was much larger in order to accomodate a bulkier logo and an oversized font. The redesign 
             lessens the font size and inserts paragraph spacing. The logo 
             was replaced by a more appropriate sized one and the Continue button 
             was adjusted to sit flush with the edges of the modal window.</p>

        <p class="subheader caida-subheader">Sign In Page</p>
        <p>I designed and implemented the onboarding process that includes the 
           sign-in, sign-up, and forgot-password screens. I also conceptualized 
           this design with the other modal windows in mind. I chose a deep 
           green to symbolize the currency that participants may earn through 
           the web platform and I employed adequate spacing and contrast.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="subheader caida-subheader">Interactive Map</p>
        <p>In order to implement a subtle yet immersive, interactive US map, I 
           dug into amCharts, a JavaScript charting and mapping library, to 
           tweak changes within the code. The result is a seamless experience 
           between interacting with the map and visualizing geographical 
           locations.There's also a home button for those who get a little carried away.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="conclusion-container">
      <div><p id="body-header">Conclusion + Takeaways</p></div>
      <div>
        <p>The onboarding process was a little tricky because I wanted 
          to dive right in and begin contributing. But instead, I had to take the time to become familiar with Meteor, get certain dependencies installed on my computer, join services for communication with the team and attain 
          access for other privileges. <br/> <br/>

          However, I later realized that good things take time and effort. Progressing through the project and absorbing knowledge from everyone made it all worth the journey. Working closely with researchers in CAIDA and getting valuable experience working with the collected 
          datasets was a privilege. Working in teams definitely helped advance 
          my design and interpersonal skills because of the opportunities to 
          receive feedback on my work that varied from mere conceptual ideas to 
          high-fidelity quality. <br/> <br/>

          Thank you to Ricky for the mentorship and guidance and to Jennifer 
          for the awesome collaboration.</p>

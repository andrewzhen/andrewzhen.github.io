          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            For summer 2018, I served as UX Developer for a 
            web platform called QUINCE, an abbreviation for Quality 
            of Internet Consumer Experience. This platform enables 
            end-users to participate in various Internet measurement 
            tasks which they can accumulate and redeem virtual 
            points for money.
          </p>

          <h4>Responsibility</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            Under the supervision of Ricky, I helped design and 
            develop the web platform to increase participant 
            engagement. Naturally, I spent some time researching 
            effective ways to gamify measurement tasks so that they 
            would appeal more to paricipants. As for the visual side, 
            I worked directly to improve the layout of pages, to 
            enhance visualizations by trying out various icons and 
            images, and to implement interactive elements. I also 
            repaired visual bugs and design breakdowns on the 
            existing platform. Last but not least, I was tasked with 
            visualizing the participants’ measurement results.
          </p>

          <h5>Consent Form</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            The consent form is the first thing participants see when 
            accessing the web platform. I expanded the form 
            vertically to cover a larger area of the screen than 
            before and a gradient shadow was placed at the bottom of 
            the form to indicate the presence of a scroll 
            functionality. At a glance, the consent form is an 
            organized, interactive element that informs participants.
          </p>

          <h5>Tutorial Modal</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            The tutorial modal window introduces participants to the 
            interface and what their tasks are. Originally, the modal 
            was much larger in order to accomodate a bulkier logo and 
            an oversized font. The redesign lessens the font size and 
            inserts paragraph spacing. The logo was replaced by a 
            more appropriate sized one and the Continue button was 
            adjusted to sit flush with the edges of the modal window.
          </p>

          <h5>Sign In Page</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            I designed and implemented the onboarding process that 
            includes the sign-in, sign-up, and forgot-password 
            screens. I also conceptualized this design with the other 
            modal windows in mind. I chose a deep green to symbolize 
            the currency that participants may earn through the web 
            platform and I employed adequate spacing and contrast.
          </p>

          <h5>Interactive Map</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            In order to implement a subtle yet immersive, interactive 
            US map, I dug into amCharts, a JavaScript charting and 
            mapping library, to tweak changes within the code. The 
            result is a seamless experience between interacting with 
            the map and visualizing geographical locations.There's 
            also a home button for those who get a little carried 
            away.
          </p>

          <h4>Conclusion and takeaways</h4>
          <p class="spacer1">
            The onboarding process was a little tricky because I 
            wanted to dive right in and begin contributing. But 
            instead, I had to take the time to become familiar with 
            Meteor, get certain dependencies installed on my 
            computer, join services for communication with the team 
            and attain access for other privileges.
          </p>
          <p class="spacer1">
            However, I later realized that good things take time and 
            effort. Progressing through the project and absorbing 
            knowledge from everyone made it all worth the journey. 
            Working closely with researchers in CAIDA and getting 
            valuable experience working with the collected datasets 
            was a privilege. Working in teams definitely helped 
            advance my design and interpersonal skills because of the 
            opportunities to receive feedback on my work that varied 
            from mere conceptual ideas to high-fidelity quality.
          </p>
          <p class="spacer3">
            Thank you to Ricky for the mentorship and guidance and to 
            Jennifer for the collaboration.

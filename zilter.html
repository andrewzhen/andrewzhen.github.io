      <div>
        <p class="line-height-210">The goal of this project was to focus on 
           hands-on practice with a modern human-centered design process while 
           building a web application to serve a set of target users. The way 
           we materialized this goal was via an web application concept that 
           aims to ease the shopping experience in its entirety by eliminating 
           the need for users to conduct research on a product.</p> <br/>
        <p class="line-height-210">Zilter’s sole purpose is to enhance the 
           recreational activity of online shopping. Online shopping for 
           entertainment gadgets and appliances (e.g. TVs, stereos, laptops, 
           headphones) can be a tedious task, especially with all the research 
           required to get the best product at the best price. This web app 
           provides the user with all the information they need to make an 
           informed decision: standard product information, photos, videos, and 
           official reviews pulled from external websites. And as always, the 
           sources are cited in a bibliography.</p>

      <div><p id="body-header">Responsibility</p></div>
      <div>
        <p class="line-height-210">My main role was to implement digital 
           mockups into user testable prototypes and in turn, present these to 
           an audience while delivering a pitch for our concept. I shared the 
           responsibility of performing user testing and turning feedback into 
           thoughtful design tweaks. </p>

    <div class="body-container">

      <div>
        <p class="subheader zilter-subheader">Branding</p>
        <p class="line-height-210">The name was inspired by the physical 
           functionality of a filter. Like a filter, we hope that our web app 
           removes unwanted noise when trying to separate out important and 
           non-important information.</p> <br/>
        <p class="line-height-210">The black and gray color scheme was chosen 
           to reflect the simplicity of our mission goal of making product 
           purchases clear and straightforward. The focus of our site are the 
           products themselves so minimal attention should go towards anything 
           else. The green accents were infused to add a splash of color 
           representing the excitement of making a purchase and also to build 
           brand identity. Furthermore, the black and green combination is 
           reminiscent of old school terminals which brings us to the new age 
           of information that our web app presents. The Zilter logo accentuates 
           the letter Z by shaping it into the silhouette of a lightning bolt 
           which represents fast access to information at one’s fingertips that 
           we hope to provide users in order to make an informed purchase.</p>

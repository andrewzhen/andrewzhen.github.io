      <div>
        <p>The goal of this course was to focus on 
           hands-on practice with a modern human-centered design process while 
           building a web application to serve a set of target users. This 
           project aims to enhance recreational activity.</p> <br/> <br/>
        <p>The way we materialized this goal was via 
           Zilter, a web application concept that eases the shopping experience 
           by consolidating all product research into one convenient place.</p> <br/> <br/>
        <p>Online shopping for gadgets and appliances 
           (e.g. TVs, laptops, headphones) can be a tedious task given that you 
           need to acquire information to get the best product at the best price. 
           Specifically, Zilter provides standard product information, photos, 
           videos and official reviews gathered from websites. The sources are 
           cited in a bibliography.</p>

      <div><p id="body-header">Responsibility</p></div>
      <div>
        <p>My main role was to implement digital 
           mockups into user testable prototypes and in turn, present these to 
           an audience while delivering a pitch for our concept. I shared the 
           responsibility of performing user testing and turning feedback into 
           thoughtful design tweaks.</p>

        <p class="subheader zilter-subheader">Need Finding</p>
        <p>For the scope of our project to enhance recreation, our team decided 
           to hone in on the opportunity to analyze breakdowns and design 
           opportunities around the online shopping experience. <br/> <br/>

           First, we conducted ad libitum sampling on three users in which the 
           observer informally records all observations that are relevant or 
           interesting. We simply asked the users to shop for an item online.</p>

        <p class="subheader">User 1 — Kevin, 19 Years Old</p>
        <p>Kevin is a 3rd year biology student who enjoys cooking and needs a 
           whetstone to sharpen his knives and a mesh strainer to filter and to 
           clean his vegetables.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="impact-container">

      <div class="caption">
        <p>I noticed, while observing Kevin, that he needed a way to figure out 
           if a product’s physical dimensions were right for him. Here, he uses 
           the width of a paper to truly understand the diameter of a strainer. 
           Although measurements were provided to him, he needed a way to compare 
           it relative to himself. To us, this was a design opportunity to improve 
           product expectations.</p>

        <p>After making an offer to a seller on Grailed, a marketplace website, 
           Charles switches over to YouTube to watch videos on the item he was 
           looking at on Grailed. Charles needs to make a better judgement of 
           the item of interest while simultaneously shopping for it. What we 
           took from this observation was that users often need external sources 
           to help them make purchasing decisions.</p>

           she is able to see the items that are on sale or at the best price 
           first. This observation shows us that users want ways to filter 
           through large quantities of products to find exactly what they are 
           looking for. </p>

        <p>In conclusion, after analyzing different users engage in online 
           browsing and shopping, we have deduced that people want the best 
           combination of quality and price. In order to meet this demand, we 
           chose to play the role that informs users instead of markets to users. 
           Essentially, we want to create the Wikipedia of shopping.</p>

        <p>Many websites used for product researching focus on a single aspect 
           of information and do not include an array of necessary data to come 
           to a decision. For example, Youtube presents videos and CNET is 
           generally acknowledged for tech reviews but neither curate sources 
           from other outlets. The concept of Zilter takes key components from 
           all over the internet to curate the most relevant content for users 
           to access on one platform. After filtering out specifics, users 
           click on a result to see photos and all the technical specifications 
           as well as critical reviews and videos that help them make the best choice.

        <img src="assets/zilter/logo.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%">
        <p>The name was inspired by the physical functionality of a filter. 
           Like a filter, we hope that our web app removes unwanted noise when 
           trying to separate out important and non-important information.</p> <br/>
        <p>The black and gray color scheme was chosen 
           to reflect the simplicity of our mission goal of making product 
           purchases straightforward. The focus of our site is the products 
           themselves so minimal attention ought to go towards anything else. 
           The green accents were infused to add a splash of color representing 
           the excitement of making a purchase and to also build brand identity. 
           Furthermore, the black and green combination is reminiscent of 
           old-school computer terminals which then brings us to the new age of 
           information that our web app presents. The Zilter logo accentuates 
           the letter Z by shaping itself into the silhouette of a lightning 
           bolt which symbolizes fast access to information at one’s fingertips 
           that we hope to provide users in order to help them make an informed 
           purchase.</p>

      <div><p id="body-header">Conclusion + Takeaways</p></div>
      <div>
        <p>Online shopping was a recreational activity that we wanted to enhance. 
           To do this, we first had to understand what about shopping that could 
           be improved on. After observing real people shop, we came up with a 
           solution that bridges the gap between wanting a product and actually 
           purchasing it: knowing which one to purchase. With this information 
           hub, users can come with their questions and leave with a clear 
           consumer intention.</p>

    <div class="conclusion-container">
      <div></div>
      <div>
        <p class="subheader zilter-subheader">Final Comments</p>
        <p>We think that Zilter has been developed well enough for its concept 
           to be understood. However, given the time and effort contraints of 
           the course (10 weeks with 3 members), we feel that we have only 
           carried out the beginning stages of the original vision.</p> <br/>
        <p>We recognize the potential for improvement of many aspects of the 
           current web app. Such areas include responsive web-design and user 
           inferface.</p>

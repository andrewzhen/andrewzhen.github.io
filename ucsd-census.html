          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            The University of California, San Diego plays an integral 
            role in helping to shape the future leaders of our state, 
            nation, and world. We have a responsibility to provide 
            students, staff, and faculty with the information and 
            opportunities to engage with the evolving world around 
            them. With the 2020 Census quickly approaching, our goal 
            is to ensure that the campus community is engaged and 
            informed about how much is at stake with this upcoming 
            census and it’s long-term impact on our communities.
          </p>

          <h4>Responsibility</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            I designed and developed the census website for UCSD. 
            Given minimal direction and visual assets, I was able to 
            deliver a responsive, interactive website in a timely 
            manner.

      Hi, I'm Andrew. <br><br>
      I was born and raised in the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area in Oakland, 
      though I did spent a couple of years as a toddler stumbling around Jiangmen, 
      China—my parents’ beloved hometown. <br><br>
      Early on, I began to take interest in art and drawing because of my brother, 
      who first took painting lessons. From then on, I was known as “that kid” 
      who drew. Though I never really pursued this artistic interest beyond middle 
      school, I made up in trying plenty of other hobbies and activities. <br><br>
      Today, I love being outdoors and especially playing basketball, practicing 
      photography and visual designs, and computer programming. Meanwhile, 
      attending UC San Diego has marked a significant period of my life. I’ve met 
      many great people and I’ve learned so much about myself and what it means 
      to attend a prestigious university in one of the best geographical places 
      in the world.

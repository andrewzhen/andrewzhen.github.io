      <div>
        <p>For a web design course spanning 5 weeks, our team was tasked with 
           designing and prototyping an accessible web application to accomodate 
           the lifestyles of people who are aged 50 and up. Our idea-turned 
           product would then participate in a Shark Tank, entrepreneur-themed 
           competition with 11 other teams with  real “sharks” (in the form of 
           senior stakeholders) judging each presentation. The result? </p>

        <p>“ SNAASH is bridging the gap between generations. The elderly can 
           share advice with those who need it and the young ones can ask for 
           guidance. Through their app, you’re able to post a question and 
           receive a thoughtful voice response from someone who may have 
           experienced it before. ” <br/><br/>

    <div class="body-container">
      <div class="work-header"><p>Responsibility</p></div>
      <div>
        <p>Given the broad prompt of creating a digital tool for a population 
           of elders, my initial contribution was helping narrow our thoughts 
           to a more focused concept: </p>
        <br/> <br/>
        <p class="subheader">Need Finding</p>
        <p>I felt that older generations needed a way to keep up-to-date with 
           younger generations in terms of culture, trends, etc. For example, 
           grandparents have a difficult time trying to understand how their 
           grandchildren are feeling and what they might be going through. They 
           might even have trouble communicating and being on the same page, so 
           to speak. So our team took this problem and we brainstormed. <br/><br/>

           Specifically, we took the needs of those seeking advice and the time 
           and wisdom of those are willing to share it and created an app concept. 
           Our concept does not focus on a method to address the needs of those 
           aged 50 and up, but of everyone of all ages. The foundation of our 
           idea stems from the former group being available for others as well 
           as a rewarding sense of connection found from helping them out.</p>

        <p>To summarize, the key challenges that we faced were: <br/>
           — helping the elderly stay connected socially <br/>
           — making communication personal and genuine in a digital world <br/>
           — finding a safe and secure platform for anyone to ask real-life, personal questions</p>

      <div>
        <p class="subheader">Information Architecture</p>
        <p>With our advice-giving idea in mind, we set out to outline the 
           information architecture, first with post-it notes then digitally 
           with more detail. We determined that we would build for mobile 
           rather than for desktop because of the prevalence of mobile devices 
           and ease of touch-opening an app as opposed to typing a web URL into 
           a browser.</p>

    <div class="impact-container">
      <div></div>
      <div class="caption">
        <p>Originally at the bottom navigation bar, we had a profile tab, a 
           home tab that leads to the feed of questions, and an ask tab (all in 
           the color blue in the image to the right). We also cared to include 
           functions such as bookmarks and history since these convenient 
           functions are usually built into apps that have extensive amounts of 
           information. Also planned was a voting system for best answers and a 
           monetary tip button for extra appreciation.</p>

        <p class="subheader">Prototyping</p>
        <p>After reviewing what was outlined, we decided we wanted to keep only 
           what was essential in order to meet usability standards as well as 
           create a streamlined user experience, especially for 50+ aged folks.
           <br/><br/>
           As a result, there were two types of screens to build for: 
           <b>answerers</b> (aged 50+) and <b>askers</b> (all ages). 
           <br/><br/>
           The answerers only need to decide between skipping a question or 
           answering it, whereas the askers can browse questions or post their own.</p>

        <p>There already exists a few other options when looking for a place 
           with advice. Our most notable competitors include Quora, Reddit, and 
           Yahoo Answers. By taking a closer look at the competition, we singled 
           each one out and created a table to summarize Snaash’s advantages 
           over each of them.</p>

        <p><b>Comments:</b> <br/>
           One complaint is that some Quora users can be immature because there 
           is no restriction on who can ask/answer questions (besides having an 
           account). By enforcing an age restriction on who can answer questions, 
           we hope to control the responses. Other Quora users, on the other hand, 
           complain about the censorship on Quora through the “be nice be 
           respectful” policy, which restricts any content that can be deemed as 
           “not nice or respectful”. Though it has good intentions, users feel 
           that they can’t freely express themselves without offending anyone. 
           We want to encourage honest, yet respectful discussions.</p>

        <p><b>Comments:</b> <br/>
           Though usernames are semi-anonymous, post/comment history is 
           available to anyone. On Snaash, we want to keep the confidentiality 
           of users who post questions seeking advice. Reddit also allows users 
           to pay, or “give gold”, to another user to unlock features. Ideally, 
           we would want Snaash to be completely free to use and ad-free.</p>

        <p><b>Comments:</b> <br/>
           Yahoo has a feature of linking all activity back to its user, which 
           the user can delete during a temporary window of time. A user can be 
           anonymous to the public through a nickname but any activity is still 
           tied to that nickname and profile. Yahoo’s forum itself has tons of 
           questions from users asking how to remain anonymous. The answers can 
           be both simple and complex. This points out that remaining anonymous 
           is in demand.</p>

        <p><b>Comments:</b> <br/>
           Snaash allows users to ask questions to a qualified group of elders 
           without having their profie revealed. Snaash borrows a feature from 
           other competitors: a voting system where the best answers can be 
           viewed at a glance. However, what sets us apart is the web app’s 
           consideration towards the answerers. To accomodate an older 
           population, answerers respond through voice messages instead of the 
           traditional way of typing an answer.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Socializing and keeping in touch with friends and family is key to a 
           longer, happier life. For our older generation, we have identified 
           that they could improve in this area. As for the younger audiences, 
           we understood that they valued resources to learn from and to express 
           their concerns. <br/><br/>

           Our web app helps these two different demographic groups with their 
           respective needs. By bringing together the wisdom of one group with 
           the eagerness of the other, Snaash creates a healthy relationship 
           between altruistic users focused on giving back to each other.</p>

        <p>Given a chance to bring Snaash to life, we would need financing to 
           pay for a team of software developers to develop the application. In 
           addition, we would need to find a way to verify the age of those 50 
           and up to avoid wrongful use of the application.</p>

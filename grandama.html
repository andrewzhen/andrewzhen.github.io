          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p class="spacer1 mono">
            Grandma + (A)sk (M)e (A)nything = GrandAMA
          </p>
          <p class="spacer3">
            This project was created from a 5 week course focused on 
            designing and prototyping an accessible mobile 
            application to accomodate the lifestyles of people ages 
            50+. Our solution bridges the gap between generations: 
            the elderly can share advice with those who need it and 
            the youth can ask for guidance. Through this app, users 
            are able to post a question and receive a thoughtful 
            voice response from someone who may have experienced it 
            before.
          </p>

          <h4>Responsibility</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            Given the broad prompt of creating a digital tool for a 
            population of elders, my initial contribution was helping 
            narrow our thoughts to a more focused concept:
          </p>

          <h5>Need Finding</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            I felt that older generations needed a way to keep 
            up-to-date with younger generations in terms of culture, 
            trends, etc. For example, grandparents have a difficult 
            time trying to understand how their grandchildren are 
            feeling and what they might be going through. They might 
            even have trouble communicating and being on the same 
            page, so to speak. So our team took this problem and we 
            brainstormed.
          </p>
          <p class="spacer1">
            Specifically, we took the needs of those seeking advice 
            and the time and wisdom of those are willing to share it 
            and created an app concept. Our concept does not focus 
            on a method to address the needs of those ages 50 and up, 
            but of everyone of all ages. The foundation of our idea 
            stems from the former group being available for others as 
            well as a rewarding sense of connection found from 
            helping them out.
          </p>

            <img src="assets/images/grandama/john.png" alt="John Doe Persona">
          </div>

          <p>
            To summarize, the key challenges that we faced were:
            <ul class="spacer3">
              <li>Help the elderly stay connected socially</li>
              <li>Make communication personal and genuine in a digital world</li>
              <li>Find a safe platform for anyone to ask real, personal questions</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            With our advice-giving idea in mind, we set out to 
            outline the information architecture, first with post-it 
            notes then digitally with more detail. We determined 
            that we would build for mobile rather than for desktop 
            because of the prevalence of mobile devices and ease of 
            touch-opening an app as opposed to typing a web URL into 
            a browser.
          </p>
          <img class="spacer1" src="assets/images/grandama/architecture-planning.jpg" alt="Architecture planning">
          <p class="spacer1">
            Originally at the bottom navigation bar, we had a profile 
            tab, a home tab that leads to the feed of questions, and 
            an ask tab (all in the color blue in the image to the 
            right). We also cared to include functions such as b
            ookmarks and history since these convenient functions are 
            usually built into apps that have extensive amounts of 
            information. Also planned was a voting system for best 
            answers and a monetary tip button for extra appreciation.
          </p>
          <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/grandama/app-flow.jpg" alt="Application flow">

          <h5>Prototyping</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            After reviewing what was outlined, we decided we wanted 
            to keep only what was essential in order to meet 
            usability standards as well as create a streamlined user 
            experience, especially for 50+ aged folks.
          </p>
          <p class="spacer1">
            As a result, there were two types of screens to build 
            for: answerers (ages 50+) and askers (all ages). The 
            answerers only need to decide between skipping a 
            question or answering it, whereas the askers can browse 
            questions or post their own.
          </p>
          <img class="spacer1" src="assets/images/grandama/prototype-critique.jpg" alt="Prototype critique">
          <p class="spacer1">
            We first conducted user testing on paper prototypes, a 
            collection of each group members’ low-fidelity mock-ups. 
            We focused our critiques on the layout of the interface 
            and the logical flow of user interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elements that we had in common included:
            <ul class="spacer3">
              <li>Simple, large navigation icons</li>
              <li>Voting system to determine the best answers</li>
              <li>Profile for answerers and their most popular advice</li>
              <li>Search and answer system separated by categories</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h5>Final Prototype</h5>
          <div class="spacer3 dual-image blend">
            <img src="assets/images/grandama/answerer.gif" alt="Answer prototype">
            <img src="assets/images/grandama/asker.gif" alt="Asker prototype">
          </div>

          <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            There already exists a few options for places that 
            provide advice. Our most notable competitors include 
            Quora, Reddit, and Yahoo Answers. Taking a closer look at 
            the competition, we singled each one out and then 
            summarized GrandAMA's advantages over them:
          </p>
          
          <img class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/quora.png" alt="Quora logo">
          <p class="spacer1">
            One complaint for Quora is that there is no restriction 
            on who can ask and answer questions. By enforcing an age 
            restriction on who can answer questions, we hope to 
            control the pool of responses. Other Quora users, on the 
            other hand, complain about the censorship on Quora 
            through the "be nice be respectful" policy, which 
            restricts any content that can be deemed as "not nice or 
            respectful". Though it has good intentions, users feel 
            that they can’t freely express themselves without 
            offending anyone. We want to encourage honest, yet 
            respectful discussions, especially as it relates to 
            personal matters.
          </p>

          <img class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/reddit.png" alt="Reddit logo">
          <p class="spacer1">
            Though usernames are semi-anonymous, post/comment 
            history is available to anyone. On grandama, we want to 
            keep the confidentiality of users who post questions 
            seeking advice. Reddit also allows users to pay, or 
            "give gold", to another user to unlock features. Ideally, 
            we would want GrandAMA to be completely free to use and 
            ad-free.
          </p>

          <img class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/yahoo.png" alt="Yahoo logo">
          <p class="spacer1">
            Yahoo has a feature of linking all activity back to its 
            user, which the user can delete during a temporary window 
            of time. A user can be anonymous to the public through a 
            nickname but any activity is still tied to that nickname 
            and profile. Yahoo’s forum itself has tons of questions 
            from users asking how to remain anonymous. The answers 
            can be both simple and complex. This points out that 
            remaining anonymous is in demand.
          </p>

          <img class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/grandama.png" alt="GrandAMA logo">
          <p class="spacer1">
            GrandAMA allows users to ask questions to a qualified 
            group of elders without having their profie revealed. 
            GrandAMA borrows a feature from other competitors: a 
            voting system where the best answers can be viewed at a 
            glance. However, what sets us apart is the web app’s 
            consideration towards the answerers. To accomodate an 
            older population, answerers respond through voice 
            messages instead of the traditional way of typing an 
            answer.

          <h4>Conclusion and takeaways</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            Our mobile application helps the two demographic groups, 
            elders and youth, with their respective needs. By 
            bringing together the wisdom of elders with the eagerness 
            to learn of the youth, GrandAMA creates a mutual 
            relationship between altruistic users intent on giving 
            back to one another.

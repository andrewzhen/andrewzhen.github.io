        <p class="spacer-1">Grandma + (A)sk (M)e (A)nything = GrandAMA</p>
        <p class="spacer-2">
          This project was created from a 5 week course focused on 
          designing and prototyping an accessible mobile application to accomodate 
          the lifestyles of people ages 50+. Our solution bridges the gap 
          between generations: the elderly can share advice with those who 
          need it and the youth can ask for guidance. Through this app, users 
          are able to post a question and receive a thoughtful voice response 
          from someone who may have experienced it before.
        </p>

        <h2 id="body-header" class="spacer-2">Responsibility</h2>
        <p class="spacer-3">
          Given the broad prompt of creating a digital tool for a population 
          of elders, my initial contribution was helping narrow our thoughts 
          to a more focused concept:
        </p>

        <h4 class="subheader" class="spacer-1">Need Finding</h4>
        <p class="spacer-1">
          I felt that older generations needed a way 
          to keep up-to-date with younger generations in terms of culture, 
          trends, etc. For example, grandparents have a difficult time trying 
          to understand how their grandchildren are feeling and what they 
          might be going through. They might even have trouble communicating 
          and being on the same page, so to speak. So our team took this 
          problem and we brainstormed.
        </p>
        <p class="spacer-3">
          Specifically, we took the needs of those seeking advice and the time 
          and wisdom of those are willing to share it and created an app concept. 
          Our concept does not focus on a method to address the needs of those 
          ages 50 and up, but of everyone of all ages. The foundation of our 
          idea stems from the former group being available for others as well 
          as a rewarding sense of connection found from helping them out.
        </p>

        <div class="five-five-container spacer-3">
          <img src="assets/grandama/jane.png" class="persona">
          <img src="assets/grandama/john.png" class="persona">
        </div>

        <p class="spacer-1">
          To summarize, the key challenges that we faced were:
          <ul class="spacer-3">
            <li>Help the elderly stay connected socially</li>
            <li>Make communication personal and genuine in a digital world</li>
            <li>Find a safe platform for anyone to ask real, personal questions</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="subheader spacer-1">Information Architecture</h4>
        <p class="spacer-2">
          With our advice-giving idea in mind, we set out to outline the 
          information architecture, first with post-it notes then digitally 
          with more detail. We determined that we would build for mobile 
          rather than for desktop because of the prevalence of mobile devices 
          and ease of touch-opening an app as opposed to typing a web URL into 
          a browser.
        </p>

        <div class="four-six-container spacer-3">
          <p class="second">
            Originally at the bottom navigation bar, we had a profile tab, a 
            home tab that leads to the feed of questions, and an ask tab (all in 
            the color blue in the image to the right). We also cared to include 
            functions such as bookmarks and history since these convenient 
            functions are usually built into apps that have extensive amounts of 
            information. Also planned was a voting system for best answers and a 
            monetary tip button for extra appreciation.
          </p>

        </div>

        <img src="assets/grandama/app-flow.jpg" class="drop-shadow-full spacer-3">

        <h4 class="subheader spacer-1">Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="spacer-1">
          After reviewing what was outlined, we decided we wanted to keep only 
          what was essential in order to meet usability standards as well as 
          create a streamlined user experience, especially for 50+ aged folks.
        </p>
        <p class="spacer-2">
          As a result, there were two types of screens to build for: 
          <b>answerers</b> (ages 50+) and <b>askers</b> (all ages). 
          The answerers only need to decide between skipping a question or 
          answering it, whereas the askers can browse questions or post their own.
        </p>

        <div class="four-six-container spacer-3">
          <div class="second">
            <p class="spacer-1">
              We first conducted user testing on paper prototypes, a collection of 
              each group members’ low-fidelity mock-ups. We focused our critiques 
              on the layout of the interface and the logical flow of user interactions.
            </p>
            <p class="spacer-1">
              Elements that we had in common included:
              <ul class="spacer-3">
                <li>Simple, large navigation icons</li>
                <li>Voting system to determine the best answers</li>
                <li>Profile for answerers + their most popular advice</li>
                <li>Search/answer system separated by categories</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

          <img src="assets/grandama/prototype-critique.jpg" class="first">

        <h4 class="subheader spacer-1">Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p class="spacer-3">
          There already exists a few options for places that provide advice. Our most 
          notable competitors include Quora, Reddit, and Yahoo Answers. Taking 
          a closer look at the competition, we singled each one out and then
          summarized GrandAMA's advantages over them:
        </p>

        <img src="assets/grandama/quora.png" class="logo spacer-1">
        <p class="spacer-4">
          One complaint for Quora is that there is no restriction on who can 
          ask and answer questions. By enforcing an age restriction on who can 
          answer questions, we hope to control the pool of responses. Other 
          Quora users, on the other hand, complain about the censorship on 
          Quora through the "be nice be respectful" policy, which restricts 
          any content that can be deemed as "not nice or respectful". Though 
          it has good intentions, users feel that they can’t freely express 
          themselves without offending anyone. We want to encourage honest, 
          yet respectful discussions, especially as it relates to personal matters.
        </p>

        <img id="reddit" src="assets/grandama/reddit-light.png" class="logo spacer-1">
        <p class="spacer-4">
          Though usernames are semi-anonymous, post/comment history is 
          available to anyone. On grandama, we want to keep the confidentiality 
          of users who post questions seeking advice. Reddit also allows users 
          to pay, or "give gold", to another user to unlock features. Ideally, 
          we would want GrandAMA to be completely free to use and ad-free.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/grandama/yahoo.png" class="logo spacer-1">
        <p class="spacer-4">
          Yahoo has a feature of linking all activity back to its user, which 
          the user can delete during a temporary window of time. A user can be 
          anonymous to the public through a nickname but any activity is still 
          tied to that nickname and profile. Yahoo’s forum itself has tons of 
          questions from users asking how to remain anonymous. The answers can 
          be both simple and complex. This points out that remaining anonymous 
          is in demand.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/grandama/grandama-light.png" class="logo spacer-1">
        <p class="spacer-4">
          GrandAMA allows users to ask questions to a qualified group of elders 
          without having their profie revealed. GrandAMA borrows a feature from 
          other competitors: a voting system where the best answers can be 
          viewed at a glance. However, what sets us apart is the web app’s 
          consideration towards the answerers. To accomodate an older 
          population, answerers respond through voice messages instead of the 
          traditional way of typing an answer.
        </p>

        <h2 id="body-header" class="spacer-2">Conclusion + Takeaways</h2>
        <p class="spacer-1">
          Our mobile application helps the two demographic groups, elders and 
          youth, with their respective needs. By bringing together the wisdom 
          of elders with the eagerness to learn of the youth, GrandAMA creates 
          a mutual relationship between altruistic users intent on giving back 
          to one another.

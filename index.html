                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p class="spacer3">
                      For summer 2018, I served as UX Developer for a 
                      web platform called QUINCE, an abbreviation for Quality 
                      of Internet Consumer Experience. This platform enables 
                      end-users to participate in various Internet measurement 
                      tasks which they can accumulate and redeem virtual 
                      points for money.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Responsibility</h4>
                    <p class="spacer3">
                      Under the supervision of Ricky, I helped design and 
                      develop the web platform to increase participant 
                      engagement. Naturally, I spent some time researching 
                      effective ways to gamify measurement tasks so that they 
                      would appeal more to paricipants. As for the visual side, 
                      I worked directly to improve the layout of pages, to 
                      enhance visualizations by trying out various icons and 
                      images, and to implement interactive elements. I also 
                      repaired visual bugs and design breakdowns on the 
                      existing platform. Last but not least, I was tasked with 
                      visualizing the participants’ measurement results.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Consent Form</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      The consent form is the first thing participants see when 
                      accessing the web platform. I expanded the form 
                      vertically to cover a larger area of the screen than 
                      before and a gradient shadow was placed at the bottom of 
                      the form to indicate the presence of a scroll 
                      functionality. At a glance, the consent form is an 
                      organized, interactive element that informs participants.
                    </p>
                    <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/caida/quince-consent-form.jpg" alt="Consent Form">

                    <h5>Tutorial Modal</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      The tutorial modal window introduces participants to the 
                      interface and what their tasks are. Originally, the modal 
                      was much larger in order to accomodate a bulkier logo and 
                      an oversized font. The redesign lessens the font size and 
                      inserts paragraph spacing. The logo was replaced by a 
                      more appropriate sized one and the Continue button was 
                      adjusted to sit flush with the edges of the modal window.
                    </p>
                    <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/caida/quince-tutorial.jpg" alt="Tutorial Modal">

                    <h5>Sign In Page</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      I designed and implemented the onboarding process that 
                      includes the sign-in, sign-up, and forgot-password 
                      screens. I also conceptualized this design with the other 
                      modal windows in mind. I chose a deep green to symbolize 
                      the currency that participants may earn through the web 
                      platform and I employed adequate spacing and contrast.
                    </p>
                    <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/caida/quince-signin.jpg" alt="Sign In Page">

                    <h5>Interactive Map</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      In order to implement a subtle yet immersive, interactive 
                      US map, I dug into amCharts, a JavaScript charting and 
                      mapping library, to tweak changes within the code. The 
                      result is a seamless experience between interacting with 
                      the map and visualizing geographical locations.There's 
                      also a home button for those who get a little carried 
                      away.
                    </p>
                    <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/caida/quince-map.jpg" alt="Interactive Map">

                    <h4>Conclusion and takeaways</h4>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      The onboarding process was a little tricky because I 
                      wanted to dive right in and begin contributing. But 
                      instead, I had to take the time to become familiar with 
                      Meteor, get certain dependencies installed on my 
                      computer, join services for communication with the team 
                      and attain access for other privileges.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      However, I later realized that good things take time and 
                      effort. Progressing through the project and absorbing 
                      knowledge from everyone made it all worth the journey. 
                      Working closely with researchers in CAIDA and getting 
                      valuable experience working with the collected datasets 
                      was a privilege. Working in teams definitely helped 
                      advance my design and interpersonal skills because of the 
                      opportunities to receive feedback on my work that varied 
                      from mere conceptual ideas to high-fidelity quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thank you to Ricky for the mentorship and guidance and to 
                      Jennifer for the collaboration.

                      The Sun God Festival is an annual music and arts festival 
                      presented by UCSD Associated Students Concerts & Events 
                      (ASCE). Of humble origins, the festival began in 1983 as 
                      a small, student-organized event that aimed to provide 
                      UCSD with a spring festival. In accordance with the San 
                      Diego climate, the 1st festival was rained out. Over the 
                      past 30 years, the festival has added student booths, 
                      vendor booths, three stages, art installations, and a 
                      campus-halting student atmosphere that is the envy of 
                      every college festival this side of the Rockies.

                    <p class="spacer3">
                      Design Co is a student-run, pre-professional design 
                      organization at UC San Diego. Our goal is to help our 
                      community prepare for an industry setting by supplementing
                      their learning with weekly events which include industry
                      talks, information sessions and workshops. Each week, we 
                      consistently see a turnout of between 50 and 100 people  
                      and students report that they form lasting connections with 
                      each other at our events.

                      This project was created from a 5 week course focused on 
                      designing and prototyping an accessible mobile 
                      application to accomodate the lifestyles of people ages 
                      50+. Our solution bridges the gap between generations: 
                      the elderly can share advice with those who need it and 
                      the youth can ask for guidance. Through this app, users 
                      are able to post a question and receive a thoughtful 
                      voice response from someone who may have experienced it 
                      before.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Responsibility</h4>
                    <p class="spacer3">
                      Given the broad prompt of creating a digital tool for a 
                      population of elders, my initial contribution was helping 
                      narrow our thoughts to a more focused concept:
                    </p>

                    <h5>Need Finding</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      I felt that older generations needed a way to keep 
                      up-to-date with younger generations in terms of culture, 
                      trends, etc. For example, grandparents have a difficult 
                      time trying to understand how their grandchildren are 
                      feeling and what they might be going through. They might 
                      even have trouble communicating and being on the same 
                      page, so to speak. So our team took this problem and we 
                      brainstormed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      Specifically, we took the needs of those seeking advice 
                      and the time and wisdom of those are willing to share it 
                      and created an app concept. Our concept does not focus 
                      on a method to address the needs of those ages 50 and up, 
                      but of everyone of all ages. The foundation of our idea 
                      stems from the former group being available for others as 
                      well as a rewarding sense of connection found from 
                      helping them out.

                      To summarize, the key challenges that we faced were:
                      <ul class="spacer3">
                        <li>Help the elderly stay connected socially</li>
                        <li>Make communication personal and genuine in a digital world</li>
                        <li>Find a safe platform for anyone to ask real, personal questions</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      With our advice-giving idea in mind, we set out to 
                      outline the information architecture, first with post-it 
                      notes then digitally with more detail. We determined 
                      that we would build for mobile rather than for desktop 
                      because of the prevalence of mobile devices and ease of 
                      touch-opening an app as opposed to typing a web URL into 
                      a browser.

                      an ask tab (all in the color blue in the image to the 
                      right). We also cared to include functions such as b
                      ookmarks and history since these convenient functions are 
                      usually built into apps that have extensive amounts of 
                      information. Also planned was a voting system for best 
                      answers and a monetary tip button for extra appreciation.

                    <h5>Prototyping</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      After reviewing what was outlined, we decided we wanted 
                      to keep only what was essential in order to meet 
                      usability standards as well as create a streamlined user 
                      experience, especially for 50+ aged folks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      As a result, there were two types of screens to build 
                      for: answerers (ages 50+) and askers (all ages). The 
                      answerers only need to decide between skipping a 
                      question or answering it, whereas the askers can browse 
                      questions or post their own.
                    </p>

                    <p class="spacer1">
                      We first conducted user testing on paper prototypes, a 
                      collection of each group members’ low-fidelity mock-ups. 
                      We focused our critiques on the layout of the interface 
                      and the logical flow of user interactions.

                      Elements that we had in common included:
                      <ul class="spacer3">
                        <li>Simple, large navigation icons</li>

                    <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      There already exists a few options for places that 
                      provide advice. Our most notable competitors include 
                      Quora, Reddit, and Yahoo Answers. Taking a closer look at 
                      the competition, we singled each one out and then 
                      summarized GrandAMA's advantages over them:
                    </p>
                    
                    <img class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/quora.png" alt="Quora logo">
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      One complaint for Quora is that there is no restriction 
                      on who can ask and answer questions. By enforcing an age 
                      restriction on who can answer questions, we hope to 
                      control the pool of responses. Other Quora users, on the 
                      other hand, complain about the censorship on Quora 
                      through the "be nice be respectful" policy, which 
                      restricts any content that can be deemed as "not nice or 
                      respectful". Though it has good intentions, users feel 
                      that they can’t freely express themselves without 
                      offending anyone. We want to encourage honest, yet 
                      respectful discussions, especially as it relates to 
                      personal matters.
                    </p>

                    <img id="reddit" class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/reddit-dark.png" alt="Reddit logo">
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      Though usernames are semi-anonymous, post/comment 
                      history is available to anyone. On grandama, we want to 
                      keep the confidentiality of users who post questions 
                      seeking advice. Reddit also allows users to pay, or 
                      "give gold", to another user to unlock features. Ideally, 
                      we would want GrandAMA to be completely free to use and 
                      ad-free.
                    </p>

                    <img class="spacer1 logo" src="assets/images/grandama/yahoo.png" alt="Yahoo logo">
                    <p class="spacer1">
                      Yahoo has a feature of linking all activity back to its 
                      user, which the user can delete during a temporary window 
                      of time. A user can be anonymous to the public through a 
                      nickname but any activity is still tied to that nickname 
                      and profile. Yahoo’s forum itself has tons of questions 
                      from users asking how to remain anonymous. The answers 
                      can be both simple and complex. This points out that 
                      remaining anonymous is in demand.
                    </p>

                    <p class="spacer1">
                      GrandAMA allows users to ask questions to a qualified 
                      group of elders without having their profie revealed. 
                      GrandAMA borrows a feature from other competitors: a 
                      voting system where the best answers can be viewed at a 
                      glance. However, what sets us apart is the web app’s 
                      consideration towards the answerers. To accomodate an 
                      older population, answerers respond through voice 
                      messages instead of the traditional way of typing an 
                      answer.

                    <h4>Conclusion and takeaways</h4>
                    <p>
                      Our mobile application helps the two demographic groups, 
                      elders and youth, with their respective needs. By 
                      bringing together the wisdom of elders with the eagerness 
                      to learn of the youth, GrandAMA creates a mutual 
                      relationship between altruistic users intent on giving 
                      back to one another.

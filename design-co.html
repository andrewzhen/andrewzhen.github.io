          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            Design Co is a student-run, pre-professional design 
            organization at UC San Diego. Our goal is to help our 
            community prepare for an industry setting by supplementing
            their learning with weekly events which include industry
            talks, information sessions and workshops. Each week, we 
            consistently see a turnout of between 50 and 100 people  
            and students report that they form lasting connections with 
            each other at our events.
          </p>

          <h4>Responsibility</h4>
          <p class="spacer1">
            As a web developer at Design Co, I'm responsible for 
            managing our website. I work closely with brand and 
            visual designers in building high-fidelity prototypes 
            using React.js while following these programming 
            principles:
            <ul class="spacer3">
              <li>DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself</li>
              <li>YAGNI – You Aren't Gonna Need It</li>
              <li>KISS - Keep It Super Simple</li>
              <li>SLAP – Single Level of Abstraction</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

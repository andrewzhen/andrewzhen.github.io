          <h4>Description</h4>

          <p class="spacer1">
            * Due to COVID-19, Sun God Festival 2020 has been 
            cancelled. Artists featured here do not reflect the 
            actual lineup.
          </p>
          <p class="spacer3">
            The Sun God Festival is an annual music and arts festival 
            presented by UCSD Associated Students Concerts & Events 
            (ASCE). Of humble origins, the festival began in 1983 as 
            a small, student-organized event that aimed to provide 
            UCSD with a spring festival. In accordance with the San 
            Diego climate, the 1st festival was rained out. Over the 
            past 30 years, the festival has added student booths, 
            vendor booths, three stages, art installations, and a 
            campus-halting student atmosphere that is the envy of 
            every college festival this side of the Rockies.
          </p>

          <h4>Responsibility</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            With the creative direction of Leo Cooperband and the 
            management of AS Concerts & Events, I developed the 
            Sun God Festival 2020 website.

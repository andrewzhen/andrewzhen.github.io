          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            ASCE, Associated Students office of Concerts & Events, is UC San 
            Diego's student programming board responsible for some of the 
            longest standing campus traditions. My teammate, Leo Cooperband, 
            and I were tasked with revamping ASCE's website for a more 
            event-driven experience by giving them a new visual identity.
          </p>

          <h4>Responsibility</h4>
          <p class="spacer3">
            With the general oversight of the ASCE team along with Leo's 
            artistic vision, I was able to implement the redesign using 
            WordPress, ASCE's current content management system, which 
            allows authorized users to easily make minor changes to the 
            website.
          </p>

          <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            The current ASCE website has a lack of focus on featuring events. 
            When users visit ASCE, they get a glimpse of a landing page that 
            features a decoration image that does not speak to ASCE as an 
            events website or as a brand. In general, the homepage does not 
            boast the most up-to-date and exciting things happening on campus, 
            which we think is a missed opportunity.
          </p>

          <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/asce/current-events.jpg" alt="current events"/>

          <h5>Wireframing</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            Our first low-fidelity prototype features a splash page with a 
            basic top navigation bar, a hero image, and an event slideshow 
            displaying past and upcoming events.
          </p>
          <img class="spacer1" src="assets/images/asce/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe"/>
          <p class="spacer3">
            We quickly realized that this initial design did not exactly feel 
            like a permanent solution to our problem: the side scrolling 
            interface for events made it difficult to access essential 
            information quickly. There was also little differentiation between 
            the importance of the content and there was room to visually improve 
            the website in order to focus the attention on the events. As a 
            result, providing students with quick information was our newfound 
            focus.
          </p>

          <h5>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            After wireframing, we began to transition our designs to a more 
            text-based approach because it offered more professionalism and a 
            method to effectively display information (which we lacked in our 
            previous design). We swapped the event slideshow for a calendar 
            list. By reformatting the events into a vertical list, we allowed 
            room for more information by having it flow as the user scrolls. 
            This design also self-contains each event, which improves 
            scanability and hierarchy. Lastly, our color choice of red and 
            tan is intended to lessen harsh contrast while having important 
            headers stand out with excitement.
          </p>

          <img class="spacer1" src="assets/images/asce/low-fidelity-events.jpg" alt="low-fidelity events"/>
          <p class="spacer3">
            Despite our modifications, we still wanted to make changes 
            regarding the visual branding of the site. ASCE brings in many 
            talented artists and performers; so for our next iteration, we 
            wanted to really highlight the talent they curate as well as the 
            art that is commissioned for their events.
          </p>

          <h5>Alternate Designs</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            To accommodate visual artwork, we pivoted directions to include 
            more images and really explore color combinations. Here in our 
            alternate designs, the image collage of the musical artists is 
            intended to draw attention to ASCE as an organization. On the other 
            hand, we incorporated event banners for each event to give each 
            one their unique theme. With the emphatic text, “We are ASCE”, 
            combined with decorative images, our client was pleased with the 
            design direction and wanted to move forward.
          </p>

          <img class="spacer3" src="assets/images/asce/alternate-designs-home-2.jpg" alt="alternate designs home 2"/>
          <img class="spacer1" src="assets/images/asce/alternate-designs-events.jpg" alt="alternate designs events"/>
          <p class="spacer3">
            With our design direction established, we wanted to polish 
            everything. First, we needed to decrease the height of each event 
            in the calendar section in order to include more in a single view. 
            Second, to elicit more excitement while maintaining 
            professionalism, Leo and I discussed ways to place images more 
            strategically. Furthermore, upon receiving student feedback on the 
            red font-color choice, we agreed that it may hinder from a 
            professional look and feel so we swapped it out.
          </p>


          <h5>Final Prototype</h5>
          <p class="spacer1">
            Based on client feedback, we continued with our image-heavy 
            approach but made changes to the splash page. We kept the 
            “We are ASCE” slogan but converted the splash page into an
            edge-to-edge slideshow, with each of ASCE's large-scale events 
            having their own image and colored theme. The full-sized images 
            help immerse the user into the website and set the tone for a 
            concert and events website. We also included a small section at the 
            bottom of the page to serve as a place for updates and other news 
            that ASCE would like to announce.

          <h4>Conclusion and Takeaways</h4>
          <p>
            From this redesign project, I've come to realize that design 
            iterations are exciting change and open the doors to many 
            possibilities but require important discussions and deliberations. 
            It's a many-week-long process, not just a result of a few 
            "productive days". Being inspired is one thing, but being practical 
            with our design decisions and thinking about the impact it has on 
            our client, ASCE, as an organization allowed us to steer this 
            project in the right direction and made this redesign a success.
